		<h4>
			Why we created <span class="brand"> Read With Me </span>
		</h4>

		We all frequently read and share news online. However, current methods are unfortunately inefficient and ineffective, especially when you want to do anything besides just forward a link.
	
		<br/>
		<br/>
	
		Born out of personal frustrations with the lack of such tools, <span class="brand"> Read With Me </span> is built with your news experience as the design priority. This is version 0.5 â€“ with many more coming!

		<h4>
			Who are we?
		</h4>


		We are friends and classmates who like to tinker and see if we can make things better.
